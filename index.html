            Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, is a bustling metropolis with a rich history and culture. You must have been overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of the city, from the chaotic traffic to the colorful bazaars. I hope you had a chance to visit some of the city's most famous landmarks, such as the National Museum, the Lalbag Fort, and the Dhakeshwari Temple.

        <p id="pcox">
            Cox's Bazar is a world-famous beach resort town located in the Chittagong Division. The beach is the longest in the world, stretching for over 120 kilometers. I can imagine that you were amazed by the vast expanse of sand and the crystal-clear waters. You must have had a lot of fun swimming, sunbathing, and exploring the local villages.
